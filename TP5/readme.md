# Authentication System with Angular and React.js

This project is a web application that implements user authentication (Signup, Login, and Logout) using **Angular** and **React.js**. The application uses **JSON Server** to simulate a REST API for storing user data. The goal of this project is to compare the implementation of the same functionalities in both Angular and React.js.
## Features
- **User Registration (Signup)**: Users can create an account by providing their name, email, and password.
- **User Login (Login)**: Users can log in using their email and password.
- **Protected Routes**: Certain pages (e.g., the home page) are only accessible to authenticated users.
- **Logout**: Users can log out, which prevents them from accessing protected pages.
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for registration and login forms.
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid inputs or failed authentication.
